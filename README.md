Memory Game
Welcome to my memory game. This is my attempt at using React to create the front end of an app. There is no server or backend to this app. This is a basic memory game using characters from It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. The goal is to not click the same face twice or you lose. My biggest issue with this app was the React itself. This app is my first attempt to create an app using React and it took a lot of getting used to mentaly. The mapping function took a while and a lot of help to get my brain around how it worked. Even figuring out how  to call the function that plays the game was confusing to me at first. Once I figured out that the mapping function was recreating all the pics each time the page reloaded, that was the moment my brain was able to get the rest to fall into place. I also had issues with adding sound to the game. That was more of getting used to how React works then anything else. In the end this app was a big stepping stone in my understanding of React and the ability to use it to create apps and websites.
